## Introduction

A project for ranking and categorizing OSS projects.
Data Collected from Github and Social Media.

## How to Get Help

If you want to help improve OSSRank directly we have a
[fairly detailed CONTRIBUTING guide in the repository][contrib] that you can
use to understand how code gets in to the system, how the project runs, and
how to make changes yourself.

## Reporting Issues

If you find any issues, feel free to report them in the [issues][issues] section of this repository.
